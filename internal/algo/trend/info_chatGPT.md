Defining a chart trend change involves identifying when a time series shifts from one pattern (uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement) to another. This can be done using various techniques depending on the data's characteristics and the level of detail required. Here are some common methods:

### 1. **Moving Averages (MA) Crossovers**
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: A trend change can be detected when a short-term moving average crosses above or below a long-term moving average.
    - **Golden Cross**: When a short-term moving average (e.g., 50-day SMA) crosses above a long-term moving average (e.g., 200-day SMA), it signals an uptrend.
    - **Death Cross**: When a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average, it signals a downtrend.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: EMAs react more quickly to recent changes and may provide an earlier signal than SMAs.

### 2. **Trendline Breaks**
- Draw trendlines along the highs and lows of the chart. A trend change can be indicated when the price breaks through these trendlines.
- For example, in an uptrend, connect a series of higher lows with a trendline. A break below this trendline can indicate a potential reversal or trend change.

### 3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
- RSI is a momentum indicator that can help identify overbought and oversold conditions.
- If the RSI moves out of overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) levels, it might indicate a potential trend change.
- RSI divergences, where the price is moving in one direction while RSI moves in the opposite, can also signal an impending trend reversal.

### 4. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
- The MACD line crossing above or below the signal line can indicate a trend change.
- When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it can signal a shift to an uptrend.
- When it crosses below, it might signal a shift to a downtrend.

### 5. **Higher Highs and Lower Lows**
- For a confirmed uptrend, each peak and trough should be higher than the previous. A downtrend shows lower highs and lower lows.
- A shift from this pattern (e.g., a higher high followed by a lower low) may indicate a trend change.

### 6. **Volume Analysis**
- Volume spikes can indicate trend reversals, especially if a breakout or breakdown happens with high volume.
- For example, an uptrend breaking down on high volume might indicate a trend change to the downside.

### 7. **Support and Resistance Breaks**
- When price breaks through established support or resistance levels, it often signals a trend change.
- For instance, if an uptrend breaches a strong support level, it might signal the start of a downtrend.

### 8. **Pattern Recognition**
- Recognizing chart patterns like **head and shoulders**, **double top/bottom**, and **ascending/descending triangles** can help identify trend changes.
- For example, a "head and shoulders" pattern at the top of an uptrend often signals a reversal to a downtrend.

### 9. **Statistical Methods (e.g., Regression Analysis)**
- Linear regression or polynomial regression can model trends and their direction. Significant changes in slope or curvature may indicate a trend change.
- **Z-scores** can also detect deviations from the mean, suggesting unusual price movements that may be signs of a trend shift.

### Choosing the Right Method
The appropriate method depends on the nature of the data, the timeframe, and the level of accuracy you need. In many cases, a combination of these methods can provide a more reliable trend change signal.
